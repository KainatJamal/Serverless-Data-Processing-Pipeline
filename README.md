# Serverless Data Processing Pipeline

## Overview
This project is a serverless data processing pipeline built using React, Node.js, and Firebase. The pipeline consists of several stages, including data ingestion, serverless functions, data storage, and analytics.

## Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Upload files to the pipeline using a web interface.
- **Serverless Functions**: Run serverless functions to process the uploaded data.
- **Data Storage**: Store the processed data in Firebase Storage.
- **Analytics**: Display analytics and insights about the processed data.
- **Orchestration**: Visualize the pipeline and its stages.
- **Settings**: Configure pipeline settings, such as processing limits.

## Architecture
The pipeline is built using a microservices architecture, with each stage running as a separate service. The services communicate with each other using RESTful APIs.

- **Data Ingestion**: A React web application that allows users to upload files to the pipeline.
- **Serverless Functions**: A Node.js application that runs serverless functions to process the uploaded data.
- **Data Storage**: A Firebase Storage bucket that stores the processed data.
- **Analytics**: A React web application that displays analytics and insights about the processed data.
- **Orchestration**: A React web application that visualizes the pipeline and its stages.
- **Settings**: A React web application that allows users to configure pipeline settings.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- **Firebase**: A cloud platform for building web and mobile applications.
- **Firebase Storage**: A cloud storage service for storing and serving files.
- **Firebase Firestore**: A cloud NoSQL database for storing and querying data.

## Usage
To use the pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Upload a file to the pipeline using the data ingestion web application.
2. The serverless functions will process the uploaded data and store it in Firebase Storage.
3. View the analytics and insights about the processed data using the analytics web application.
4. Visualize the pipeline and its stages using the orchestration web application.
5. Configure pipeline settings using the settings web application.
